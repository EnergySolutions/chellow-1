      <p>
        The CRC report has a row for each supply. A supply is in one of the
        the following categories at any one time:
        <ul>
          <li>HH</li>
          <li>AMR</li>
          <li>NHH</li>
          <li>Unmetered</li>
        </ul>
        The report works out the number of days with actual data for each
        category and totals them up to give the 'Total Actual Days'. It then
        works out the maximum possible number of days with actual data for each
        supply category (HH, AMR, NHH or Unmetered) and totals them up to give
        the 'Total Max Actual Days'. If (actual / maximum) >= 183 / 365, the
        supply is classed as 'Actual' for the CRC period, otherwise it is 
        classed as 'Estimated'. The total (estimated + actual) kWh are given
        for each category.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a period of time (the span) when a supply is in the NHH category,
        the kWh and number of normal days are worked out as follows.
        <ul>
          <li>
            All reads that aren't 'actual' are discarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remaining reads are ordered by time. The earliest and the
            latest reads that lie within the span are retained. The latest read 
            (no matter how late) before the beginning of the span is retained.
            The earliest read (no matter how early) after the end of the span
            is retained. All other reads are discarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the reads still in order, all the span segments are
            considered. A segment is just a read and the next read, so for
            n reads there are n - 1 segments. The kWh for each segment is
            calculated.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the two reads of a segment lie within the span, the days of
            the segment are added to the actual days. The kWh of the segment is
            added to the total kWh.
          </li>
          <li>
            If one or both the reads lie outside the span, no days are added
            to the actual days. The kWh for the segment is multiplied by (days
            of segment that are also in the period) / (total days in segment),
            and then added to the total kWh.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there's a meter change at some point along the line of reads,
            there will be two reads for the same point in time. One of the
            reads is the end of the preceding segment, and the other one is the
            beginning of the succeeding segment, so it's always the case that
            the two reads that make up a segment belong to the same meter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For AMR and HH categories, the kWh figure is found by summing the kWh
        for all the half-hours that lie within the period. The number of actual
        days is found by (number of actual half-hours / 48). The report
        doesn't fill in any missing data.
